# pym2aia-examples

to run the examples install [MÂ²aia](https://github.com/m2aia/m2aia).

1. ``` pip install git+https://github.com/m2aia/pym2aia.git ```
2. ``` git clone https://github.com/m2aia/pym2aia-examples ```
3. ``` cd pym2aia-examples ```
4. ``` git submodule update --recursive --init ```
5. ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

By running an example, the required data set [MTBLS2639](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2639/) will be downloaded automatically. 
This will take some time (e.g. in Example I only one slice of four is downloaded, that takes about 12 minutes).
